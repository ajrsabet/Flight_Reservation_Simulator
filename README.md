# Project Overview: Flight Reservation System

## Introduction
The Flight Reservation System is a software application designed to help customers book flights, view reservations, cancel reservations, and simulate boarding. This project aims to provide a practical implementation of priority queues.

## Objectives
- Implement a flight reservation system with core functionalities.
- Practice using priority queues to manage reservations based on seat class priority.
- Develop a user-friendly GUI interface using Java Swing.

## Features
- **Book a Flight**: Allows users to book a flight by selecting a seat and entering their details.
- **View Reservations**: Users can view their current reservations.
- **Cancel a Reservation**: Users can cancel an existing reservation.
- **Boarding Simulation**: Simulates the boarding process based on seat class priority.

## Technologies Used
- **Java**: The primary programming language used for the implementation.
- **PriorityQueue**: Java's priority queue data structure for managing reservations.

## Project Structure
- **Main.java**: The main entry point of the application.
- **Flight.java**: Represents a flight with seats and related operations.
- **Passenger.java**: Represents a passenger with relevant details.
- **Reservation.java**: Represents a reservation with flight, passenger, and seat details.
- **TypeWriter.java**: Utility class to simulate typing effect in the console.
- **PriorityQueue.java**: Custom implementation of a priority queue.
- **PassengerComparator.java**: Comparator for ordering passengers based on seat class priority.
- **ConsoleDisplay.java**: Utility class for displaying information in the console.

## Usage
1. **Run the Application**: Execute the `Main` class to start the flight reservation system.
2. **Interact with the System**: Use the console or GUI interface to book flights, view reservations, cancel reservations, and simulate boarding.
